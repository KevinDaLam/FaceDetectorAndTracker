# Face Detector And Tracker
This is a mounted smartphone tracker that uses OpenCV for face recognition. The project calculates the center coordinates of detected faces through the smartphone camera in Python and communicates those values to an Arduino Uno that repositions the servo motors. The movement of these motors will adjust to align the detected face in the centre of the image. This process continues repeatedly to create a tracking surveillance system.
